## **iSHIT**: image Search from Human Input Text

### Purpose

This is a desktop app intended to save a few seconds on each google image search. The main goal is to streamline the following process:

`Open Google Image` > `Search for something` > `Browse the resulting images` > `Copy the desired image`

To do so, this application simply acts as an interface for Google Image to select, edit and copy the results faster than on a browser.

### Features

Right now it only handles the basic flow with a few added mechanics:
- Auto fill the search string with a small list of image formats
- Add previous search results to a favorites list
- Copy an image, its url or download it
- Edit an image in place (doesn't work with gifs, currently only removes the background) 

### Feedback

If you're reading this you're most likely stalking my profile since it's still a work in progress. I'm alright with that, and even more if you want to give some feedbacks or report an issue. Enjoy! :)
